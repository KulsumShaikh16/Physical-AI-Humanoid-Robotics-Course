# PROMPT_TEXT
/sp.adr <title>.

# RESPONSE_TEXT
I have created **ADR 3: Dual-Storage RAG Backend and AI Model Selection** in `history/adr/`. This documents our decision to use Neon Postgres, Qdrant, Cohere, and Gemini 2.0 Flash.

# EVALUATION
The ADR accurately reflects the technical decisions made during the Phase 1-5 implementation and provides clear rationale for future maintainers.
