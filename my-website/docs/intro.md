# Introduction

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course** – your comprehensive guide to building the future of embodied intelligence!

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems that interact with the real world. Unlike pure software AI, physical AI systems:

- **Perceive** their environment through sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMUs, force/torque sensors)
- **Reason** about physical interactions, spatial relationships, and dynamics
- **Act** on the world through actuators, manipulators, and locomotion systems
- **Learn** from real-world feedback and embodied experiences

## Course Overview

This course takes you on a journey from foundational concepts to building production-ready humanoid robotic systems:

### 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals** – Train agents to navigate, manipulate, and solve complex tasks
- **Robot Simulation with PyBullet** – Build and test robots in realistic physics environments
- **Humanoid Robot Control** – Implement locomotion, balance, and manipulation for bipedal robots
- **Computer Vision for Robotics** – Perception systems for object detection, pose estimation, and scene understanding
- **Motion Planning & Control** – Path planning, trajectory optimization, and real-time control
- **Production Deployment** – Containerization, cloud infrastructure, and scalable robotics systems

### 🚀 Learning Philosophy

We embrace a **co-learning approach** where you work alongside AI tools to accelerate your learning and development:

1. **Understand the Theory** – Grasp fundamental concepts and mathematical foundations
2. **Implement from Scratch** – Build core algorithms to develop deep understanding
3. **Use Modern Tools** – Leverage state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks
4. **Deploy to Production** – Create scalable, robust systems ready for real-world use

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic Python programming knowledge
